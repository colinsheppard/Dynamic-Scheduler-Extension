# NetLogo Dynamic Scheduler Extension

This package contains the NetLogo dynamic scheduler extension, which provides support for a new datatype (schedule objects) and associated operations (adding, removing, and dispatching events on the schedule) in NetLogo. 

## Using

Installation and usage instructions to be written after the extension is prototyped...

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogoLite.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 make

If compilation succeeds, `dynamic-scheduler.jar` will be created.
